# Iris Dataset Analysis

This project involves performing basic data analysis and visualization on the Iris dataset using Python. The dataset is loaded from `sklearn.datasets`, and three tasks are performed: data exploration, basic analysis, and data visualization.

---

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset
- **Objective**: Load the Iris dataset using `sklearn.datasets`, convert it into a pandas DataFrame, and inspect the first few rows. The dataset's structure is explored by checking the data types and identifying any missing values. Missing values are handled through either filling or dropping.

---

### Task 2: Basic Data Analysis
- **Objective**: Perform basic statistical analysis of the numerical columns (mean, median, standard deviation) using pandas' `.describe()`. Additionally, group the data by species and compute the mean of numerical columns for each species. Observations are made on trends and patterns found in the dataset.

---

### Task 3: Data Visualization
- **Objective**: Create four types of visualizations:
  - A **line chart** to show trends over time.
  - A **bar chart** comparing numerical values across categories (e.g., average petal length per species).
  - A **histogram** to understand the distribution of a numerical column.
  - A **scatter plot** to visualize the relationship between two numerical columns (e.g., sepal length vs. petal length).
  Each plot is customized with appropriate titles, labels, and legends to provide clarity.
